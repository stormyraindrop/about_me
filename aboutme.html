<h3>The BasicsðŸ˜œ</h3>

<p>My name is Araina Peterson, I am 16 years old and I turn 17 on October 20th. My mother is white and my father was Dominican. I am currently a highschool student studying at Academy for Careers in Television and Film. I have had brief job entering and organizing data. animals are my passion so I definately want to work with animals one day. My most desireable profession to me right now is a wildlife rehabilitator. When wild animals get sick or injured it would be my job to nurse them back to health and ideally set them free. To do this I would major in Animal Behavior and go to graduate school for Veterinary science.</p>

<p>I draw often and I am on my school's volleyball team. I live in a single parent household and i have no human siblings. My mom has A couple pets and I had a couple pets. One of my most beloved passed away before the school year started. He was a bearded dragon and his name was Zeus. I love reptiles but they are difficult to take care of in captivity especially because there are few vets that specialize in reptiles. Zeus was anemic and passed on the 31st of August.</p>

<h3>TechnologyðŸ“±</h3>

<p>I use my phone daily as most american teenagers do. I LOVED my 15 inch macbook pro but my mom's 20 pound cat walked over it and cracked the screen (R.I.P.). I could not Afford to replace it so I bought an iPad and a keyboard which usually works for all my school work.</p>
